Apache Spark vs Akka
Apache Spark is actually built on Akka.

Akka is a general purpose framework to create reactive, distributed, parallel and resilient concurrent applications in Scala or Java. Akka uses the Actor model to hide all the thread-related code and gives you really simple and helpful interfaces to implement a scalable and fault-tolerant system easily. A good example for Akka is a real-time application that consumes and process data coming from mobile phones and sends them to some kind of storage.

Apache Spark (not Spark Streaming) is a framework to process batch data using a generalized version of the map-reduce algorithm. A good example for Apache Spark is a calculation of some metrics of stored data to get a better insight of your data. The data gets loaded and processed on demand.

Apache Spark Streaming is able to perform similar actions and functions on near real-time small batches of data the same way you would do it if the data would be already stored.
